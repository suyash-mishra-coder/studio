/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Mockview AI.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and their associated mock interview sessions.
 * Users can only access their own data, ensuring privacy and preventing unauthorized access.
 * Anonymous access is disabled by default.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profile information.
 * - `/users/{userId}/mockInterviewSessions/{sessionId}`: Stores mock interview sessions for each user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to prevent enumeration.
 * - All writes are explicitly authorized to prevent accidental open access.
 * - The `freeTrialsRemaining` field is managed by application logic, and the rules do not directly enforce trial limits.
 * - No validation is performed on data types or required fields, except where necessary to maintain relational integrity (e.g., userId consistency).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *   Authorization is based on path-based ownership, so no denormalization is needed.
 * Structural Segregation:
 *   All user-specific data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, providing clear segregation.
